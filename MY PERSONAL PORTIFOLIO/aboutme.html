            I am a web/content developer. I love to incorporate
            science with technology to produce beautiful things. 
            My specialty is in creating well thought of interphase 
            and generally, designs.
            Solely, I thrive to make web and technology readily
            available and easily understood by the user. I also
            work on uniting users with their respective designers
            and developers.
